  description: Carbon Monitoring for Action (CARMA) was a global database that gathered
    and presented the best available estimates of CO2 emissions for 50,000 power plants
    around the world and the identities of the 4,000 firms that own them. Electricity
    production is responsible for about one-quarter of all climate-warming greenhouse
    gas pollution, and CARMA was the only global database for tracking specific sources
    of CO2, the most important greenhouse gas. First launched in 2007, CARMA was expanded
    and upgraded in 2012 to incorporate data from authorities in the United States,
    European Union, Canada, India, and South Africa as well as the International Atomic
    Energy Agency. For facilities lacking publicly-disclosed data, estimates were
    generated using a new suite of statistical models. The objective of CARMA was
    to provide information necessary to create a cleaner, low-carbon future. By providing
    complete information for both clean and dirty power producers, CARMA hopes to
    influence the opinions and decisions of consumers, investors, shareholders, managers,
    workers, activists, and policymakers. CARMA builds on experience with public information
    disclosure techniques that have proven successful in reducing traditional pollutants.
    CARMA is no longer active and the last update was November 28, 2012.

    Abstract

    The structure of the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) system and
    how it is used in the OECM are described, as well as how the statistical data
    of the International Energy Agency (IEA) were merged with the GICS structure.
    The development of the pathways for the industry and service sectors, based on
    the GICS and IEA data, is explained, together with the parameters that are important
    for the financial industry. In this context, the definitions of Scope 1, 2, and
    3 emissions newly developed for the OECM are explained, as well as how the systemic
    error of double counting in the original procedure can now be avoided.'

  description: Mitigating climate change necessitates global cooperation, yet global
    data on individuals’ willingness to act remain scarce. In this study, we conducted
    a representative survey across 125 countries, interviewing nearly 130,000 individuals.
    Our findings reveal widespread support for climate action. Notably, 69% of the
    global population expresses a willingness to contribute 1% of their personal income,
    86% endorse pro-climate social norms and 89% demand intensified political action.
    Countries facing heightened vulnerability to climate change show a particularly
    high willingness to contribute. Despite these encouraging statistics, we document
    that the world is in a state of pluralistic ignorance, wherein individuals around
    the globe systematically underestimate the willingness of their fellow citizens
    to act. This perception gap, combined with individuals showing conditionally cooperative
    behaviour, poses challenges to further climate action. Therefore, raising awareness
    about the broad global support for climate action becomes critically important
    in promoting a unified response to climate change.

  description: 'General Explanation

    Countries receive scores on each indicator as a fractional rank relative to all
    countries for which data is available (after most data is corrected for GDP, i.e.
    the economic size of the country). The actual simple ranks per category are based
    on the mean fractional ranks on the 5 indicators per category (subject to maximum
    2 missing values per category). The overall rank is based on the average of the
    category ranks. In case of equal overall ranks, the country with the lowest low
    score on any of the 7 categories gets pushed down.


    GOOD COUNTRY INDEX 1.5


    Overall Rank


    The overall rank is based on the average of the category ranks. 26 (out of 35)
    indicators are based on 2020 data, 7 on 2019 data, 2018 data for Renewable energy
    share, and 2017 Ecological footprint data. The actual overall rank is based on
    169 countries included in the index and the mean rank score for the 7 category
    ranks.'

  description: 'Ireland’s Climate Change Assessment (ICCA) for the first time provides
    a comprehensive and authoritative assessment of the state of knowledge around
    all key aspects of climate change, with a central focus on Ireland. The objective
    of Ireland’s Climate Change Assessment (ICCA) is the following:


    To deliver a comprehensive report on our understanding of climate change.

    The option to respond to the challenges it poses.

    To identify opportunities that may arise from the planned transition to a climate
    neutral, biodiversity-rich, environmentally sustainable and climate resilient
    economy and society.

    The report provides an assessment of our understanding of climate change, tying
    together all available lines of evidence to provide actionable information. This
    is based on scientific research and systematic observations in Ireland, linked
    to EU and global analysis. ICCA aims to provide summary information that can inform
    decision-making on climate actions.


    ICCA also covers the following:


    Identifying research gaps to inform future research investment needs and priority
    research issues.

    Contributing to the development of a national assessment and analysis capacity.

    Enhancing engagement with similar developments at European and international levels.

    Establishing a structure and process to develop future reports.

    The ICCA report is provided in four volumes. Each volume includes a short Summary
    for Policymakers. Accompanying the four volumes is a Synthesis Report which integrates
    key findings across the underlying volumes and provides an accessible overall
    summary.'

      Ash ponds + storage        Often exceeds 50–100 hectares        EPA (U.S.),
      India CEA

      Combined average footprint        ~80–150 hectares per coal plant site (with
      ash & stack zones)'
    formula: 'Suppose 1,000 Mt coal extracted annually via mountaintop:


      Land use = 1,000 Mt × 12 m² = 12,000,000 m² = 1,200 ha


      Coal ash footprint (449 plants): ~3,592 ha


      Combined = ~4,792 ha total land conversion, or ~4.8 ha per Mt coal


      land conversion into your Ecological Score (#4) like this:


      Land Conversion (ha/Mt) =

      (Mt_coal × 0.0012 ha/Mt) + (#_ash_plants × avg_ash_ha) / Mt_coal'
